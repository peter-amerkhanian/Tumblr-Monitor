# Tumblr Monitor - Java Practice
This app is mostly to help me practice using Java. It is also a functioning program 
that can read in the URL of a tumblr page, e.g. "http://frickin-idiot.tumblr.com/", and
will return all of the posts on the front page of the Tumblr converted into 
only their photos, the date posted, and a link to the actual post.
